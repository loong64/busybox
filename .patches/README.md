# BusyBox Patches

This directory contains patches we apply during our various builds of BusyBox.  They are not necessarily *all* applied to all builds, but they are intended to be as minimal as possible, focused primarily on compilation or correctness issues, such that we still represent upstream's releases accurately.

Metadata in each patch should be following [Debian's "DEP-3" Patch Tagging Guidelines](https://dep-team.pages.debian.net/deps/dep3/) to ensure we track appropriate provenance (and that they were submitted upstream in some form, or that we're explicitly tracking our justification for *why* we didn't do so).
